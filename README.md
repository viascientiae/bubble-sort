# Ruby Bubble Sort Project

## Project Overview
I'm delighted to present the "Ruby Bubble Sort" project, a fundamental component of the "Basic Ruby Projects" section from the "Ruby" course in the "Full Stack Ruby on Rails" path of The Odin Project. This project serves as a deep dive into one of the foundational sorting algorithms in computer science, allowing me to understand its intricacies and implement it from scratch in Ruby.

Sorting algorithms are crucial in various computer operations, and while bubble sort might not be the most efficient, understanding its mechanics is essential for any budding software developer.

## Key Learning Objectives
Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my capabilities in:

- **Algorithm Implementation**: Grasping the logic behind the bubble sort algorithm and implementing it effectively in Ruby.
- **Array Manipulation**: Enhancing my skills in handling and processing arrays to achieve desired outcomes.
- **Problem Solving**: Tackling the challenges of sorting and ensuring the algorithm works seamlessly for various input scenarios.
- **Git & GitHub Usage**: Emphasizing the importance of version control by making regular commits and providing comprehensive documentation of my code changes.

## Project Description
The main task revolves around building a method named `#bubble_sort`:

1. It accepts an array of numbers.
2. It returns the array sorted in ascending order using the bubble sort methodology.

For instance:

```ruby
bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
# Expected output: [0,2,2,3,4,78]
```

## Additional Resources
I found this video from Harvardâ€™s CS50x on Bubble Sort to be particularly enlightening: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kp-8OGwphY
The Wikipedia entry on Bubble Sort also offers a comprehensive overview of the algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort

## Getting Started
To ensure the success of this project, I:

- **Repository Setup**: Initialized a GitHub repository to chronicle the project's development.
- **Algorithm Development**: Focused on understanding the bubble sort algorithm's logic and then translating that understanding into functional Ruby code.
- **Testing**: Rigorously tested the method with various input scenarios to ensure its reliability and accuracy.
- **Documentation**: Kept the README updated and added inline comments for clarity on the code's functionality and logic.

## Conclusion
The "Ruby Bubble Sort" project has been an enlightening journey into the world of sorting algorithms. As I continue my adventure with The Odin Project, I'm eager to delve deeper into more complex algorithms and data structures, further refining my skills in Ruby and software development as a whole.
